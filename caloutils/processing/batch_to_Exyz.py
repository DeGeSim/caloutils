def batch_to_Exyz(batch: Batch) -> Batch:
    """
    Transforms the cylindrical coordinate representation (z, alpha, r) in a batch of graphs to Cartesian coordinates
    (x, y, z), and calculates pseudo-rapidity (eta) and azimuthal angle (phi) for each node in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : Batch
        The batch of graphs where each node feature vector includes a cylindrical coordinate representation
        (Energy, z, alpha, r) where z is the long axis of the cylindrical coordinate system, alpha is the
        azimuthal angle, and r is the radial distance from the z-axis.

    Returns
    -------
    batch : Batch
        The modified batch object where an additional "xyz" attribute is added which includes the Cartesian coordinates
        for each node in the graphs. Additionally, "eta" (pseudo-rapidity) and "phi" (azimuthal angle) attributes are
        calculated and added to the batch object.

    Note
    ----
    Pseudo-rapidity (eta) and azimuthal angle (phi) are commonly used in particle physics to describe the direction
    of a particle relative to the beam axis (z-axis in this context).
