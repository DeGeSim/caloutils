    Calculates specified variables for each event in a batch.

    The function supports calculation of "sphereratio", "cyratio", "fpc", "showershape",
    and "response". Calculated variables are added to the input batch object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : Batch
        A Batch object from the PyTorch Geometric library that contains the point cloud
        representation of the events.
    fake : bool, optional
        If True, sums up the energy of duplicate hits in an event. Defaults to False.
    vars : list of str, optional
        List of variables to calculate for the events in the batch. Defaults to all
        supported variables: ["voxel","sphereratio","cyratio","fpc","showershape","response"].

    Returns
    -------
    Batch
        The input Batch object with calculated variables added.
